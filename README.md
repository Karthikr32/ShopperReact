# Welcome to my Shopper.com ðŸ‘‹
ShopperReact is a simple e-commerce application built with React. It provides the basic structure of an e-commerce site, allowing users to interact with products, and potentially add them to a cart, though further features could be added for a full-fledged app.

## 1. React-app
- The project is built using React, which follows the component-based architecture. React components help to break down the app into smaller, reusable UI pieces. Each section of the UI, such as the product list, product card, and cart, can be a separate component.
- React's JSX is used to build the UI. JSX allows mixing JavaScript logic with HTML-like syntax, making it easier to visualize the structure of the components.

## 2. React Router
- This app has multiple pages (e.g., a homepage, product page, cart page), it's likely that React Router could be used to handle navigation without reloading the page. This would provide a Single Page Application (SPA) experience, which is common in modern e-commerce websites.

## 3. Product List
- The core of the app is probably a list of products that the user can browse through. Each product can have details such as name, price, and image, all of which are displayed as cards or tiles.

- The Product Component could take product data as props and render it dynamically.

## 4. Add to Cart
- The Add to Cart functionality would be crucial in an e-commerce app. Users can add products to a shopping cart, which would then be reflected in the UI.
- When a user clicks "Add to Cart," the app would update the state to reflect the new items in the cart.

## 5. Component Reusability:
- The use of React's components makes the app highly modular and reusable. Components such as ProductCard, ProductList, CartItem, etc., can be reused to render various parts of the app. This also keeps the codebase clean and maintainable.

## 6. Context API
- In this e-commerce applications, some global states such as cart items, user authentication status, or theme preferences need to be accessed by many different components at various levels of the component tree.

- **A context provider** is used at a higher level (like in App.js) to make certain global states accessible to the entire app.
- **The consumer components** (like Cart, ProductList, or Header) then access the context without having to pass data down as props.

## 7. Checkout Functionality
- A crucial feature for any e-commerce site is checkout functionality. This could include creating a checkout page, implementing a dummy Checkout format using only front-end technologies and enabling order confirmations.
